Sometimes my courage fails me and I
think I ought to stop working, live in
the country and devote myself to
gardening. But I am held by a thousand
bonds, and I don't know when I shall
be able to arrange things otherwise.
Nor do I know whether, even by
writing scientific books, I could live
without the laboratory. Marie Curie
