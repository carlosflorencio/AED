I believe there exists, and I feel within
me, an instinct for the truth, or
knowledge or discovery, of something
of the same nature as the instinct of
virtue, and that our having such an
instinct is reason enough for scientific
researches without any practical results
ever ensuing from them. Charles
Darwin
